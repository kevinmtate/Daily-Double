Write a function that converts HEX to RGB. Then Make that function auto-dect the formats so that if you enter HEX color format it returns RGB and if you enter RGB color format it returns HEX.

*Note:* I took in the input as all strings so if its hex its "B6CD23" and if it's RGB it's "rgb(182,205,35)" and then did some conversion
